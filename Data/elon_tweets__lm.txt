{"text": "I‚Äôm in Boca every week, so maybe we could talk then. Given that Starship is not exactly subtle, this is more of a design clarification to match what people can already see."}
{"text": "Good point. Probably next week in form of a written piece on SpaceX website."}
{"text": "Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful."}
{"text": "Yup. With beta updates, there‚Äôll be a lot of 2 steps fwd, 1 step back situations, but pace of improvement will be extremely fast."}
{"text": "Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command."}
{"text": "Starship is coming together!"}

{"text": "Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn‚Äôt achieve anything, but I‚Äôm confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights."}
{"text": "Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps."}
{"text": "FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow & cautious, as it should."}
{"text": "Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate."}

{"text": "Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely."}
{"text": "Pretty accurate. It‚Äôs not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code & inform immune system what to attack."}
{"text": "London to Beijing would be cool"}

{"text": "For sure"}
{"text": "Maybe a month or so. Some finishing touches need to be done on the stations."}
{"text": "We simplified this a lot. It‚Äôs basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds."}

{"text": "Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It‚Äôs just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian."}
{"text": "With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn‚Äôt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it‚Äôs right."}
{"text": "Thank you, much more accurate haha"}
{"text": "This graph appears to be upside down"}
{"text": "Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is >75% automated. Only wire harnesses & general assembly, which are <10% of production costs, are primarily manual."}
{"text": "Will release order configurator probably in Jan"}
{"text": "Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert & careful drivers."}
{"text": "The SoC‚Äôs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it‚Äôs fairly obvious when one is discordant"}
{"text": "Tesla FSD computer‚Äôs dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes ‚Äî they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails."}
{"text": "Accurate analysis. Quite a few ego/intelligence>>1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements."}
{"text": "Glad Jen is safe!"}
{"text": "Wow"}
{"text": "Uh ok, here we go ‚Ä¶"}
{"text": "I don‚Äôt think this is accurate"}

{"text": "I have seen no evidence of an advanced civilization visiting Earth. Fuzzy pics that are worse than a 7/11 security cam frame grab don‚Äôt count!"}
{"text": "We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It‚Äôs not a question of money. If there was a ‚Äúgreat engineer‚Äù factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build."}
{"text": "Definitely"}
{"text": "Exactly. He plays the ‚Äúpoor inventor‚Äù card, but was rich all along & invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house & had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."}
{"text": "There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard‚Äôs problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 & Ze‚Äôev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO."}
{"text": "When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me & the board, no one left with him. That says it all."}

{"text": "Probably"}
{"text": "I have that exact art on the wall of the place I stay in Boca Chica!"}
{"text": "Yes, failure to protect nursing homes was a major mistake (happened in most countries). Herd immunity for vast majority of people & quarantine vulnerable was right though imo."}
{"text": "Sweden was right"}
{"text": "There are sensitive elements, but they‚Äôre on the inside. Also, a good telephoto lens will be able to capture what I‚Äôve posted. And yeah, anyone who can reverse engineer what I‚Äôve posted doesn‚Äôt need to reverse engineer!"}
{"text": "Great work by SpaceX valve engineering & production!"}
{"text": "Our tiles are mechanically attached"}
{"text": "It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions."}
{"text": "Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal."}
{"text": "Compilers need to improve imo. Most type, pointer (or other memory) problems can be detected at compile time or disambiguated by asking the user."}
{"text": "I‚Äôm proud to say that that nose is pointier than it needs to be haha"}
{"text": "Norway leads the world"}
{"text": "Passed cryo proof"}
{"text": "Yeah, it‚Äôs not a contest. Advanced casting crushes best-case 3D printing, but casting doesn‚Äôt work well for complex enclosed volumes & high strength or high temp alloys."}
{"text": "Great pics!"}
{"text": "Maybe this should be the flag of Mars"}
{"text": "Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation. It‚Äôs already sensible for rocket engine parts. To the best of our knowledge, SpaceX is 2 or 3 years ahead of other companies in use of additive."}
{"text": "Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note"}
{"text": "Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won‚Äôt need to wait for FSD."}
{"text": "It should be"}
{"text": "Exactly. We barked up that tree for way too long (sigh). Gives a false sense of victory being close ‚Äî a tantalizing local maximum ‚Äî but reality is just too messy & weird. Our new system is capable of driving in locations we never seen even once."}
{"text": "Yes, we will play sexy snake jazz ü§£"}
{"text": "Yes"}
{"text": "Yeah, provided we do our metal gear snake autocoupler"}
{"text": "Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks."}
{"text": "Yeah, we could put in a setting allowing it to drop as low as 5%"}
{"text": "Great render. Note, there will need to be an arm that lifts booster to launch stand & ship to booster."}
{"text": "Mimecraft"}
{"text": "Yes"}

{"text": "The crash absorption rails can be cut off & replaced with a bolted part for collision repair"}
{"text": "Sandy Munro understands engineering"}
{"text": "That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one."}
{"text": "Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest & most critical product"}
{"text": "Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper & lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity & improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough."}
{"text": "But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term."}
{"text": "Even GM & Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy."}
{"text": "The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three."}
{"text": "Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it‚Äôs fun & takes ~100 people. Production takes >10,000 people & hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly."}
{"text": "Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate."}
{"text": "Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."}
{"text": "We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars & stationary storage"}
{"text": "Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack & front & rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont & Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."}
{"text": "They are"}
{"text": "I do so wish that more companies would put down their spreadsheets for a moment and focus on making products that move your heart"}
{"text": "7 bar absolute, which is fine for flight. This was a proof test, rather than a burst test. We‚Äôll hopefully fix the leak today & retest."}
{"text": "Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking"}
{"text": "One of the best shots ever!"}
{"text": "Much sooner"}
{"text": "Great photo!"}
{"text": "It will soon"}
{"text": "Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US & hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval."}
{"text": "We‚Äôre not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections."}
{"text": "Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that‚Äôs needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour."}
{"text": "Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster & 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster & fairing by end of next year."}
{"text": "4th flight & landing for this booster"}

{"text": "Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China."}
{"text": "Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world"}
{"text": "Fair point :)"}
{"text": "Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too."}
{"text": "Up to 80% false positive"}
{"text": "Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."}
{"text": "Do you have data on the false positive rate? I‚Äôve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and ‚Äúpresumed positive‚Äù."}

{"text": "Yes"}
{"text": "No new domestic corona cases in China"}
